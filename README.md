📚 Scotbook –  Bookstore Website (Hand-Coded)

A clean, responsive bookstore website inspired by my original Wix design.

Scotbook is a fully hand-coded, multi-page bookstore experience recreated from my original Wix website concept.
This version demonstrates my ability to translate a visual design into functional HTML + CSS, using clean code, reusable components, and modern layout techniques.
