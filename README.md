# Scotbook – Multi‑page Bookstore (Hand‑coded)

This project is a **hand‑coded recreation** of my original Wix website “Scotbook”, an online bookstore concept.

- Original Wix site: https://dinushinilakshika.wixsite.com/scotbook
- Tech stack: **HTML + CSS**
- Structure: **Multi‑page** (Home, Shop, About, Contact)

---

## Pages

- `index.html` – Home page with hero section, category preview and newsletter subscription.
- `shop.html` – “Shop All” page with a responsive **book grid** grouped by category and a “Best Selling” section.
- `about.html` – About Scotbook + “About Authors” layout.
- `contact.html` – Contact details + contact form layout.

---

## Features

- Sticky top navigation with dropdown “Categories” menu.
- Re‑usable footer with contact information and helper links.
- Animated elements:
  - Buttons with a light hover “bounce”.
  - Cards that gently raise on hover (`hover-raise` class).
- Responsive layout using CSS grid and flexbox for:
  - Category cards
  - Book grid
  - About and Contact page layouts

---

## How to run this project locally

1. Download or clone the repository.

2. Open the folder in your editor:

   ```bash
   cd scotbook-multipage
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser (double‑click it or use a live server extension).

You can navigate between pages using the top navigation bar.

## Ideas for future improvements

- Replace placeholder book titles, authors and prices with real data.
- Connect the contact form to a real backend or form service.
- Rebuild this layout in **React** or **Next.js** for an even more advanced portfolio project.
